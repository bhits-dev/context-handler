# Context Handler API

The Context Handler API is a RESTful web service component of Consent2Share. It is responsible for sending XACML response context that includes authorization decisions along with applied policy obligations to Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) API components. The Context Handler sends the XACML request context to the Policy Decision Point (PDP). The PDP evaluates the applicable policies either from the Patient Consent Management (PCM) or a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) server against the request context, and returns the response context that includes authorization decisions along with obligations of applied policies to the Context Handler. The Context Handler sends XACML response context back to the PEP component. The PDP uses [HERAS-AF](https://bitbucket.org/herasaf/herasaf-xacml-core/overview), an open source XACML 2.0 implementation, for XACML evaluation, and uses either a PCM database as a local policy repository or a FHIR server to retrieve XACML policies that are generated from patientsâ€™ consents.
   

## Build

### Prerequisites

+ [Oracle Java JDK 8 with Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
+ [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (for building a Docker image from the project)
+ [Logback-Audit](http://audit.qos.ch/)

### Commands

This is a Maven project and requires [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.3.3 or greater to build it. It is recommended to use the *Maven Wrapper* scripts provided with this project. *Maven Wrapper* requires an Internet connection to download Maven and project dependencies for the very first build.

To build the project, navigate to the folder that contains `pom.xml` file using the terminal/command line.

+ To build a JAR:
    + For Windows, run `mvnw.cmd clean install`
    + For *nix systems, run `mvnw clean install`
+ To build a Docker Image (this will create an image with `bhits/context-handler:latest` tag):
    + For Windows, run `mvnw.cmd clean package docker:build`
    + For *nix systems, run `mvnw clean package docker:build`

## Run

### Prerequisites

1. This API uses the PCM database as a local policy repository to retrieve XACML policies. Thus, it needs to have a database user configuration with read privileges to the PCM database. Please see the [Configure](#configure) section for details of configuring the data source.
2. As an alternative, this API can also be configured to retrieve XACML policies from a FHIR server. The following properties are required to be added in `application.yml`. Please see [Configure](#configure) section for more details.
```yml
c2s:
  context-handler:
	...
	fhir:
	      enabled: true
	      # configure fhir server base url
	      serverUrl: <<server-url>>
	      clientSocketTimeoutInMs: 768000
	      ssn:
	        system: http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-ssn
	        oid: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.1
	        label: SSN
	      npi:
	        system: http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi
	        oid: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.6
	        label: PRN
	      pou:
	        system: http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActReason
	        oid: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.20448
	        label: PurposeOfUse
	      mrn:
	        system: https://bhits.github.io/consent2share/
	        oid: urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.13.20.200
	        label: MRN
    ...
```

3. This API also needs to call the Logback-Audit server, so please follow the [Logback-Audit deployment instruction](https://github.com/bhits/logback-audit) to set it up.
4. After the Logback-Audit server is up, the hostname (currently is localhost) in the [default configuration](context-handler/src/main/resources/application.yml) needs to be replaced with the real server name.
Logback-Audit configuration section in the configuration file

```yml
...
    audit-service:
      host: localhost
      port: 9630
...
```

### Commands

This is a [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) project and serves the API via an embedded Tomcat instance. Therefore, there is no need for a separate application server to run this service.
+ Run as a JAR file: `java -jar context-handler-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar <additional program arguments>`
+ Run as a Docker Container: `docker run -d bhits/context-handler:latest <additional program arguments>`

*NOTE: In order for this API to fully function as a microservice in the Consent2Share application, it is required to set up the dependency microservices and support level infrastructure. Please refer to the [Consent2Share Deployment Guide](https://github.com/bhits/consent2share/releases/download/2.1.0/c2s-deployment-guide.pdf) for instructions to set up the Consent2Share infrastructure.*

## Configure

This API utilizes [`Configuration Server`](https://github.com/bhits/config-server) which is based on [Spring Cloud Config](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config) to manage externalized configuration, which is stored in a `Configuration Data Git Repository`. We provide a [`Default Configuration Data Git Repository`]( https://github.com/bhits/c2s-config-data).

This API can run with the default configuration, which is targeted for a local development environment. Default configuration data is from three places: `bootstrap.yml`, `application.yml`, and the data which `Configuration Server` reads from `Configuration Data Git Repository`. Both `bootstrap.yml` and `application.yml` files are located in the `resources` folder of this source code.
  		  
We **recommend** overriding the configuration as needed in the `Configuration Data Git Repository`, which is used by the `Configuration Server`.
  		  
Also, please refer to [Spring Cloud Config Documentation](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html) to see how the config server works, [Spring Boot Externalized Configuration](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html) documentation to see how Spring Boot applies the order to load the properties, and [Spring Boot Common Properties](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html) documentation to see the common properties used by Spring Boot.

### Examples for Overriding a Configuration in Spring Boot

#### Override a Configuration Using Program Arguments While Running as a JAR:

+ `java -jar context-handler-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=80 `

#### Override a Configuration Using Program Arguments While Running as a Docker Container:

+ `docker run -d bhits/context-handler:latest --server.port=80 `

+ In a `docker-compose.yml`, this can be provided as:
```yml
version: '2'
services:
...
  context-handler.c2s.com:
    image: "bhits/context-handler:latest"
    command: ["--server.port=80"]
...
```
*NOTE: Please note that these additional arguments will be appended to the default `ENTRYPOINT` specified in the `Dockerfile` unless the `ENTRYPOINT` is overridden.*

### Enable SSL

For simplicity in development and testing environments, SSL is **NOT** enabled by default configuration. SSL can easily be enabled following the examples below:

#### Enable SSL While Running as a JAR

+ `java -jar context-handler-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=ssl --server.ssl.key-store=/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore --server.ssl.key-store-password=strongkeystorepassword`

#### Enable SSL While Running as a Docker Container

+ `docker run -d -v "/path/on/dockerhost/ssl_keystore.keystore:/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore" bhits/context-handler:latest --spring.profiles.active=ssl --server.ssl.key-store=/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore --server.ssl.key-store-password=strongkeystorepassword`
+ In a `docker-compose.yml`, this can be provided as:
```yml
version: '2'
services:
...
  context-handler.c2s.com:
    image: "bhits/context-handler:latest"
    command: ["--spring.profiles.active=ssl","--server.ssl.key-store=/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore", "--server.ssl.key-store-password=strongkeystorepassword"]
    volumes:
      - /path/on/dockerhost/ssl_keystore.keystore:/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore
...
```

*NOTE: As seen in the examples above, `/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore` is made available to the container via a volume mounted from the Docker host running this container.*

### Override Java CA Certificates Store In Docker Environment

Java has a default CA Certificates Store that allows it to trust well-known certificate authorities. For development and testing purposes, one might want to trust additional self-signed certificates. In order to override the default Java CA Certificates Store in a Docker container, one can mount a custom `cacerts` file over the default one in the Docker image as follows: 

`docker run -d -v "/path/on/dockerhost/to/custom/cacerts:/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts" bhits/context-handler:latest`

*NOTE: The `cacerts` references refered to in the volume mapping above are files, not directories.*
