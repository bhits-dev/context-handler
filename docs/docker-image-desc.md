# What is Context Handler?

The Context Handler (CTX) API is a RESTful web service component of Consent2Share (C2S). It is responsible for sending XACML response context that includes authorization decisions along with applied policy obligations to Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) API components. The Context Handler sends the XACML request context to the Policy Decision Point (PDP). The PDP evaluates the applicable policies from the Patient Consent Management (PCM) against the request context, and returns the response context that includes authorization decisions along with obligations of applied policies to the Context Handler. The Context Handler sends XACML response context back to PEP component. The PDP uses [HERAS-AF](https://bitbucket.org/herasaf/herasaf-xacml-core/overview), an open source XACML 2.0 implementation, for XACML evaluation and uses a PCM database as a local policy repository to retrieve XACML policies that are generated from patientsâ€™ consents.

# How to use this image


## Start a Context Handler instance

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the repository's [README.md](https://github.com/bhits/context-handler) file before starting the instance.

`docker run  --name context-handler -d bhits/context-handler:latest <additional program arguments>`

*NOTE: In order for this API to fully function as a microservice in the Consent2Share application, it is required to setup the dependency microservices and support level infrastructure. Please refer to the [Consent2Share Deployment Guide](https://github.com/bhits/consent2share/releases/download/2.0.0/c2s-deployment-guide.pdf) for instructions to setup the Consent2Share infrastructure.*


## Configure

This API runs with a [default configuration](https://github.com/bhits/context-handler/blob/master/context-handler/src/main/resources/application.yml) that is primarily targeted for the development environment.  The Spring profile `docker` is actived by default when building images. [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) supports several methods to override the default configuration to configure the API for a certain deployment environment. 

Here is example to override default database password:

`docker run -d bhits/context-handler:latest --spring.datasource.password=strongpassword`

## Using a custom configuration file

To use custom `application.yml`, mount the file to the docker host and set the environment variable `spring.config.location`.

`docker run -v "/path/on/dockerhost/C2S_PROPS/context-handler/application.yml:/java/C2S_PROPS/context-handler/application.yml" -d bhits/context-handler:tag --spring.config.location="file:/java/C2S_PROPS/context-handler/"`

## Environment Variables

When you start the Context Handler  image, you can edit the configuration of the Context Handler  instance by passing one or more environment variables on the command line. 

### JAR_FILE

This environment variable is used to setup which jar file will run. you need mount the jar file to the root of container.

`docker run --name context-handler -e JAR_FILE="context-handler-latest.jar" -v "/path/on/dockerhost/context-handler-latest.jar:/context-handler-latest.jar" -d bhits/context-handler:latest`

### JAVA_OPTS 

This environment variable is used to setup JVM argument, such as memory configuration.

`docker run --name context-handler -e "JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx700m -Xss1m" -d bhits/context-handler:latest`

### DEFAULT_PROGRAM_ARGS 

This environment variable is used to setup application arugument. The default value of is "--spring.profiles.active=docker".
